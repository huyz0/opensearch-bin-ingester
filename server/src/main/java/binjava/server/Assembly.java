 *
 * <p>⚠️ **THE PIECES HAVE ALL BEEN TESTED AND HAVE NEVER BEEN IN ONE OBJECT
 * GRAPH.** That is what this class is for, and it is why its own tests assert
 * CONNECTEDNESS rather than behaviour: a root that hands the writer one store
 * and the sequencer another, or exposes a hub nothing publishes to, compiles,
 * starts, and loses data in a way no unit test of any single component can see.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **NOTHING HERE LISTENS ON A SOCKET.** The HTTP front door, the
 * retention loop, the GC lease and the progress reporter are wired in later
 * tasks (M8.4, M8.5, M8.6), each one commit, because a root that arrives last
 * discovers every composition failure at once.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ **THE TRANSPORT IS A PARAMETER AND NOT BUILT HERE**, because no
 * production {@link SequencerTransport} exists yet — M5.6e, owed since M5 and
 * scheduled as M8.20. Taking it as an argument is the honest shape until then:
 * this root can be assembled and asserted today, and M8.20 changes one call
 * site rather than this class's design.
